Guide to Order model

1) Create a new Order object with orderer and location kwargs
2) Create new OrderItem objects with order, menu_item, quantity, notes kwargs
3) Retrieve total price with order_object.total_price

4) Update with a fulfilling user with order_object.fulfil_order(<user>)
5) Exchange code with order_object.get_code() and .check_code(<code>)
    This is a uuid.UUID object, but it can be modified if you want a shorter form
6) Close order with order_object.close_order()
